Title: Global Optimization by Differential Evolution in C++
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel extending DEoptim (by David Ardia, Katharine Mullen,
 Brian Peterson, Joshua Ulrich) which itself is based on DE-Engine (by Rainer Storn)
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: An efficient C++ based implementation of the 'DEoptim'
 function which performs global optimization by differential evolution.  
 Its creation was motivated by trying to see if the old approximation "easier,
 shorter, faster: pick any two" could in fact be extended to achieving all
 three goals while moving the code from plain old C to modern C++.  The
 initial version did in fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to 
 an implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have
 since been eliminated in 'DEoptim'.
