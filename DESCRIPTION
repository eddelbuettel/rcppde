Title: Global optimization by differential evolution in C++
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel extending DEoptim (by David Ardia, Katharine Mullen,
  Brian Peterson, Joshua Ulrich) which itself is based on DE-Engine (by Rainer Storn)
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: This package provides an efficient C++ based implementation of the
  DEoptim function which performs global optimization by differential evolution. 
  Its creation was motivated by trying to see if the old approximation "easier,
  shorter, faster: pick any two" could in fact be extended to achieving all
  three goals while moving the code from plain old C to modern C++.  The
  initial version did in fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to 
  an implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have
  since been eliminated in DEoptim.
