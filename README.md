### About

The package provides global optimization by differential evolution.

It uses an efficient C++ based implementation of the DEoptim
function which performs global optimization by differential evolution.  Its
creation was motivated by trying to see if the old approximation "easier,
shorter, faster: pick any two" could in fact be extended to achieving all
three goals while moving the code from plain old C to modern C++.  The
initial version did in fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to an
implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have since
been eliminated in DEoptim.

Storn.
